# Machine Learning Journey

This repository documents my structured learning journey into Machine Learning, including theory, code implementations, projects, and experiments.

# File Structure

- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks organized by topics.
- `notes/` – Markdown notes for theory, logs, and key takeaways.
- `scripts/` – Python scripts for reusable code (e.g., preprocessing, model utils).
- `data/` – Raw and processed datasets (add .gitignore for large data).
- `images/` – For visualizations, diagrams, or screenshots.
